      Hi! I'm Joe. I'm a 27 year old web developer specializing in front end
      development and React framework applications. When I'm not designing and
      building websites, I love spending time outdoors, training Brazilian
      Jiu-Jitsu, and traveling the world with my wife. I also speak German, and
      am a huge dog lover.
